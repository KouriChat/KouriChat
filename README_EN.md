## Introduction
English · [简体中文](./README.md) 
- My Dream Moments is an emotional companion program based on a large language model (LLM) that can connect to WeChat, providing a more authentic emotional interaction experience. It features the Atri-My Dear Moments prompt and addresses the rigid question-and-answer format of traditional human-machine dialogue, offering immersive role-playing and multi-turn conversation support. The project name stems from the original title of the first intelligent agent running on this program combined with the project's core values.
- It is recommended to use the DeepSeek V3 model.

## How to Run the Project
### 1. Preparations
1. **Spare Phone/Android Emulator**  
   - The WeChat desktop client must be logged in simultaneously on a mobile device, so using your primary device is not advisable.
2. **WeChat Secondary Account**  
   - You need to register an older WeChat account (newly registered accounts may not be able to log in as a bot). If you encounter an error after scanning, please check this requirement.
3. **DeepSeek API Key**  
   - It is recommended to obtain it from: [Get API Key (15 yuan free quota)](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/aQXU6eC5)

### 2. Deploy the Project
1. **Clone this Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_address>
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure `config.py`**  
   Modify `DEEPSEEK_API_URL` and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. Adjust `MAX_TOKEN`, `TEMPERATURE`, and `MODEL` as needed.
4. **Run `bot.py`**  
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

### 3. How to Use
1. **After running the project, a `QR.png` will be generated in the root directory.**
   - Use this QR code to log in with the WeChat account you want to use as a bot.
   - If there is no response in the console, please restart the project to refresh the QR code and try logging in again.
2. **When the console displays `Start auto replying.`, it indicates that the program is running successfully. You can now test the bot by chatting with it on WeChat.**

## Modifying the Prompt
- The `prompt.md` file in the project root directory can be edited to modify prompts. Changes will take effect upon restarting the project.
- Note: Please do not alter prompts related to the backslash `\`, as they are utilized for segmented message replies.
